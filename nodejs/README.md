## Introduction

In this article, I walk through the steps of setting up a simple server using Node.js and Express. This server serves as a starting point for any Node.js and Express applications.

You can read the full article on Medium: [Simple Node.js Express Server](https://medium.com/@abednahouli/simple-node-js-express-server-c74d9f8178cc)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 12 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abednahouli/medium.git
   cd nodejs
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run:
```bash
node index.js
```

The server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

```
medium-nodejs-express-server/
├── index.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

- `index.js`: The main file that sets up the Express server.
- `package.json`: Contains the project's metadata and dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The server will respond with a simple message, confirming that it's running correctly.
